# Kodo — Track Your Development Activities

Kodo is a **developer activity tracker** with a clean terminal UI, built in Rust using [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui).  
It helps you log activities, track time, and even sync your **Git commits** into the dashboard — so you get real stats about your coding sessions without extra effort.

---

## Features

- 📋 **Activities table** — log tasks you’re working on.
- ⏱ **Duration tracking** — keep track of how much time you spend.
- 📊 **Stats view** — toggle a bar chart of activity durations.
- 🌱 **Git integration** — automatically sync commit history from the current repo as activities.
- 💾 **Persistent storage** — saves activities to a JSON file on disk.
- 🖥 **TUI navigation** — built with `ratatui` for a fast, keyboard-driven UI.

## 🗂 Data Storage

Kodo stores activities in a JSON file (by default in your project directory).
Each activity has:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Fix login bug",
  "duration_minutes": 45,
  "date": "2025-09-04"
}
```
